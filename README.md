Lab created for Computer Science 3 class. Objective of lab is to focus on using the built in Java Map and Set collections.In a normal game of hangman, the computer picks a word that the user is supposed to guess. The user then
guesses individual lettersuntilthewordis fullydiscovered. If youarenâ€™tfamiliarwiththegeneralrulesof
the game of hangman, review its Wikipedia page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)
In our (EVIL!) game of hangman, the computer delays picking a word until it is forced to. As a result,
the computeris always considering a set ofwords that could be the answer. In orderto fooltheuserinto
